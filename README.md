# ReactNative To-Do App

This is a React Native To-Do app that I built to practice and showcase my React Native skills. The app allows users to:

- **List the todos**: The app displays all the tasks in a scrollable list.
- **Mark a todo done by simply clicking on it**: Users can easily mark a task as completed by tapping on it.
- **Delete the todo by long pressing it**: Users can remove a task by long-pressing it and confirming the deletion.
- **Add a todo by filling a dialogue box**: Users can add new tasks by filling out a prompt dialogue box.
- **Filter the in-progress, done, and all tasks using tabs**: Users can switch between different tabs to view tasks based on their completion status.

The app has a clean and intuitive user interface, making it easy for users to manage their tasks.
